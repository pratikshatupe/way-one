    <h3  style="color:mediumaquamarine; font-size:20px;"> PANIR TIKKA</h3> 
    <img src="./../images/panir bg.png"/>
    <p> " India's star paneer dish is definitely the paneer tikka. Many believe it was invented in the 1960s at Delhi's Ranjit Hotel. Since then, any restaurant with a tandoor makes sure to put it on the menu. Some restaurants even go as far as putting it on pizzas, making paneer tikka pizza a popular dish in some regions."</p>

    <h3  style="color:mediumaquamarine; font-size:20px;"> PAV BHAJI</h3>
    <img src="./../images/pav bhaji.jfif"/>
    <p> "Pav was introduced by the Portuguese in Mumbai. The cube-shaped bread is called â€œPavâ€ by the Portuguese and is prepared from Maida (refined wheat flour). Although the Portuguese left Mumbai over three centuries ago, Pav still rules the city and has become an intrinsic ingredient of Mumbai's food culture."</p>

    <h3  style="color:mediumaquamarine; font-size:20px;"> KOLHAPURI MISAL</h3>
    <img src="./../images/misal.webp"/>
    <p>"Misal is prepared in part with sprouted lentils and has less water content and a watery, spicy "cut" or "bite". It has two parts, a thick curry of matki, called usal, and watery gravy, also called rassa. Usually people mix these two according to their taste and requirement." </p> <hr>
