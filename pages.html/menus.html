    <p> " India's star paneer dish is definitely the paneer tikka. Many believe it was invented in the 1960s at Delhi's Ranjit Hotel. Since then, any restaurant with a tandoor makes sure to put it on the menu. Some restaurants even go as far as putting it on pizzas, making paneer tikka pizza a popular dish in some regions."</p>

    <p> "Pav was introduced by the Portuguese in Mumbai. The cube-shaped bread is called â€œPavâ€ by the Portuguese and is prepared from Maida (refined wheat flour). Although the Portuguese left Mumbai over three centuries ago, Pav still rules the city and has become an intrinsic ingredient of Mumbai's food culture."</p>
